This code will help you create a fucntion to access Spotify API.
This function gets access from Spotify, makes requests to get data for the playlist or album you want, formats the data, and creates a csv file.

You can use this csv file for further analysis or visualization!

The Jupyter notebook includes explanation of the code, part-by-part.
